# Context and Follow-up Fix Implementation

This document describes the changes made to fix the context loss and generic follow-up issues in the Organic Chemistry Tutor.

## Problems Fixed

1. **Context Loss**: The model wasn't remembering previous conversation turns
2. **Generic Follow-ups**: The model kept asking unnecessary questions instead of giving direct answers

## Changes Made

### 1. System Prompt Update (`prompts/system_prompt.txt`)
- **Before**: Verbose, chatty prompt that encouraged generic follow-ups
- **After**: Minimal, focused prompt that:
  - Keeps responses brief (1-6 sentences)
  - Disables generic follow-up questions unless strictly needed
  - Focuses on grounding responses in provided context
  - Maintains occasional Nepali mixing for clarity

### 2. Chat Memory System (`server/chat_memory.py`)
- **New**: `ChatMemory` class that manages conversation history with rolling window
- Features:
  - Token budget management (6000 tokens default)
  - Pragmatic token estimation (4 chars/token)
  - Rolling window that preserves system prompt + context
  - Per-chat session memory management

### 3. Backend Integration (`server/ollama_proxy.py`)
- **Updated**: `/api/rag-chat` endpoint to use ChatMemory
- Changes:
  - Integrates conversation history with each request
  - Optimizes RAG context (reduced from 4 to 3 chunks, 500 chars max)
  - Sets temperature to 0.3 for deterministic responses
  - Adds final reminder to prevent generic follow-ups
  - Uses chat_id for memory session management

### 4. Frontend Update (`chat-ui/index.html`)
- **Updated**: Sends chat_id with each request for memory management
- Ensures each conversation maintains its own memory context

## Key Benefits

1. **Persistent Context**: Each conversation now maintains context across turns
2. **Focused Responses**: No more generic "Would you like to know more?" questions
3. **Optimized Performance**: Shorter, more relevant RAG context
4. **Deterministic Output**: Lower temperature for consistent responses
5. **Memory Management**: Automatic rolling window prevents token overflow

## Technical Details

### Memory Management
- Each chat session gets its own `ChatMemory` instance
- Memory automatically trims oldest messages when token budget exceeded
- System prompt and RAG context are preserved during trimming

### RAG Optimization
- Reduced context chunks from 4 to 3 for better focus
- Limited snippet length to 500 characters
- Added source references when available

### Temperature Control
- Set to 0.3 for more deterministic, less chatty responses
- Helps prevent generic follow-up generation

## Usage

The system now automatically:
1. Maintains conversation context across turns
2. Provides focused, direct answers
3. Only asks clarifying questions when strictly necessary
4. Optimizes RAG context for better relevance

No changes needed in user interaction - the improvements are backend-only.
